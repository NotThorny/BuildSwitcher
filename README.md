# Build Switcher Basics

### This plugin was put together relatively quickly and has some somewhat specific requirements.

Items are saved so builds can be used across accounts.

 If you need more than 52 builds then you should optimize your builds :)

## Installation
**Prebuilt JAR:** 
- Get latest BuildSwitcher.jar release from [releases](https://github.com/NotThorny/BuildSwitcher/releases) and place it in your `\grasscutter\plugins` folder.
 
 Restart the server if it was already running.
 
 ## Usage
 
`/set save [a - z]` to save current artifacts

- eg. /set save c
 
`/set load [a - z]` to load saved artifacts

- eg. /set load p

Builds can use a - z for first 26 slots, and a1 - z1 for 26 more slots.
