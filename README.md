# Build Switcher Basics

Save your artifacts in reusable sets, which can be easily equipped on any character.

Items are saved so builds can be used across all accounts on the server.

## Installation
**Prebuilt JAR:** 
- Get latest BuildSwitcher.jar release from [releases](https://github.com/NotThorny/BuildSwitcher/releases) and place it in your `\grasscutter\plugins` folder.
 
 Restart the server if it was already running.
 
 ## Usage
 
`/set save [name]` to save current artifacts

- eg. /set save overkill
 
`/set load [name]` to load saved artifacts

- eg. /set load cool50

Builds can use any name you want!

`/set list` to see all saved builds
