# Build Switcher Basics

### This plugin was put together relatively quickly and has some somewhat specific requirements.

Saved builds use the items directly from your inventory, no new items are made. This means you can't use saved builds on other accounts.

If you delete the items from your inventory then the build won't load the missing items.

 If you need more than 26 builds then you should optimize your builds :)

## Installation
**Prebuilt JAR:** 
- Get latest BuildSwitcher.jar release from [releases](https://github.com/NotThorny/BuildSwitcher/releases) and place it in your `\grasscutter\plugins` folder.
 
 Restart the server if it was already running.
 
 ## Usage
 
`/at save [a - z]` to save current artifacts

- eg. /at save c
 
`/at load [a - z]` to load saved artifacts

- eg. /at load p
